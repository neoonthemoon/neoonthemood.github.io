# Neo On The Moon

Welcome to the repository for **Neo On The Moon**, a dynamic and interactive GitHub Pages website!

## Features

This project brings the following elements to life:

- **Dynamic Title:** The title "NEO ON THE MOON" is prominently displayed at the top of the page with a constantly changing color animation.
- **Central Circle:** A visually appealing static circle centered on the page.
- **Bouncing Ball Animation:** A lively ball bounces around the screen, adding energy and interactivity to the site.

## Getting Started

This project is hosted on GitHub Pages. To view the website:

1. Visit [neoonthemoon.github.io](https://neoonthemoon.github.io) (replace this URL with the actual link if different).
2. Enjoy the interactive elements and animations.

## Installation

If you'd like to run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/neoonthemoon.github.io.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser to see the website in action.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for the website structure.
- **CSS3** for styling and animations.
- **JavaScript** for dynamic elements like the bouncing ball.

## How It Works

- The title uses a CSS `@keyframes` animation to change colors continuously.
- The circle in the center is styled with CSS for simplicity and focus.
- The bouncing ball uses JavaScript to calculate its position and reverse direction upon hitting the screen edges.

## Customization

You can adjust the following:

- **Title Animation:** Modify the `@keyframes` in the CSS to use different colors or animation speeds.
- **Ball Behavior:** Change the speed or size of the ball by editing the `JavaScript` variables.
